various swift ring builder calls and functions.  It is called with one
parameter which is a json encoded string that contains the 'arguments' string
with the following parameters:

{
    'path': The function that needs ot be performed
    'args': the non-keyword argument to supply to the swift manager call.
    'kwargs': any keyword args to supply to the swift manager call.
}

The result of the call, or an error, is returned as a json encoded result that
is printed to the STDOUT,  Any errors are printed to STDERR.

The format of the output has the same keys as, but in a compressed form:

{
    'result': <whatever the result of the function call was>
    'error': <if an error occured, the text of the error
}

This system is currently needed to decouple the majority of the charm from the
underlying package being used for keystone.
