    'args': the non-keyword argument to supply to the swift manager call.
    'kwargs': any keyword args to supply to the swift manager call.
}

The result of the call, or an error, is returned as a json encoded result that
is printed to the STDOUT,  Any errors are printed to STDERR.

The format of the output has the same keys as, but in a compressed form:

{

underlying package being used for keystone.
