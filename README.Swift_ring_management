== Swift Charm Ring Management ==

Swift uses rings and builders to manage data distribution across storage devices
in the cluster. More information on this can be found in the upstream
documentation [0].

In order to function correctly, the rings and builders need to be the same
across all swift proxy units and the rings need to be distributed to storage
units. The swift proxy charm achieves this by electing a leader unit and having
that unit manage ring and builder files by updating them when new nodes or
devices are added to the cluster and distributing those files to other nodes in
the cluster.

Since over time the leader may change, rings syncs use acknowledgements from
peer units to determine whether a synchronisation has completed. This was if
the leader switches to another unit, we are able to know that that unit has
up-to-date ring and builder files.

When new devices are added to storage units, the leader proxy unit is notified
and adds them to the ring. Once complete, the leader unit will broadcast a
notification that rings and builders are ready to be synced across the cluster
(only proxy units get builders) and each unit in the cluster should then begin
syncing from the leader and acknowledge receipt.

During synchronisation, swift-proxy services are stopped in order to avoid
having requests being handled while rings are being updated.
