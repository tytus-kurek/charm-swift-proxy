1) TO BE TESTED AGAIN.

Relating swift-storage-region2 application to swift-proxy-region1
application through the cross-controller relation is not sufficient. The
swift-storage-region2 application has to be first related to
swift-proxy-region2 application. Otherwise the swift-storage-region2
application hangs in an "Incomplete relation" status. This means there is
something wrong with the cross-controller relations.

DOES NOT WORK:

juju switch maas-region1
juju offer swift-proxy-region1:swift-storage
juju switch maas-region2
juju consume maas-region1:admin/swift-region1.swift-proxy-region1
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region1

WORKS:

juju switch maas-region1
juju offer swift-proxy-region1:swift-storage
juju switch maas-region2
juju consume maas-region1:admin/swift-region1.swift-proxy-region1
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region2
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region1

2) When swift-storage-region2 application is related to swift-proxy-region1
application and then it gets related to swift-proxy-region2 application, the
swift-proxy-region2 application will overwrite the rings.

DOES NOT WORK:

juju switch maas-region1
juju offer swift-proxy-region1:swift-storage
juju switch maas-region2
juju consume maas-region1:admin/swift-region1.swift-proxy-region1
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region1
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region2

WORKS

juju switch maas-region1
juju offer swift-proxy-region1:swift-storage
juju switch maas-region2
juju consume maas-region1:admin/swift-region1.swift-proxy-region1
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region2
juju relate swift-storage-region2 swift-proxy-region1

3) TO BE TESTED AGAIN.

There are some checks in the the swift-proxy charm code (which shouldn't be
there BTW) which don't allow multiple replicas if certain conditions are not
met. For the time being I've added an additional check so that if the
'enable-multi-region' option is set, those are ignored. This should be solved
properly, however.

4) Exclude the "custom-hosts-allow" charm option.

5) Master - Slave relation in HA mode.
