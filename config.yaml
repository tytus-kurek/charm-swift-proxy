      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.

      How long the proxy server will wait on responses from the

    description: |
      How long the proxy server will wait for an initial response and to read a
      chunk of data from the object servers while serving GET / HEAD requests.
      Timeouts from these requests can be recovered from so setting this to
      something lower than node-timeout would provide quicker error recovery
      while allowing for a longer timeout for non-recoverable requests (PUTs).
  # Swift ring management config
  partition-power:
    type: int
    default: 8
    description: |
      This value needs to be set according to the parameters of the cluster
      being deployed. In order to achieve an optimal distribution of objects
      within your cluster without over consuming system resources it is
      important that this value not be too low or high but it must also be
      high enough to account for future expansion of your cluster since it
      cannot be changed once the rings have been built. A rough calculation
      for this value should be no less than log2(total_disks * 100).
  replicas:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: Minimum replicas for each object stored in the cluster.
  min-hours:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      This is the Swift ring builder min_part_hours parameter. This
      setting represents the amount of time in hours that Swift will wait
      between subsequent ring re-balances in order to avoid large i/o loads as
      data is re-balanced when new devices are added to the cluster. Once your
      cluster has been built, you can set this to a higher value e.g. 1
      (upstream default). Note that changing this value will result in an
      attempt to re-balance and if successful, rings will be redistributed.
  disable-ring-balance:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      This provides similar support to min-hours but without having to modify
      the builders. If True, any changes to the builders will not result in a
      ring re-balance and sync until this value is set back to False.
  zone-assignment:
    type: string
    default: "manual"
    description: |
      Which policy to use when assigning new storage nodes to zones.
      .
        manual - Allow swift-storage services to request zone membership.
        auto - Assign new swift-storage units to zones automatically.
      .
      The configured replica minimum must be met by an equal number of storage
      zones before the storage ring will be initially balance. Deployment
      requirements differ based on the zone-assignment policy configured, see
      this charm's README for details.

      The hostname or address of the public endpoints created for swift-proxy
      in the keystone identity provider.

      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be

      Setting this value (and ssl_key) will enable reverse proxying, point

      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string

  static-large-object-segments:
    default: 0
    type: int
    description: |
      Enable Static Large Objects (SLO) support. This allows the user to
      upload several object segments concurrently, after which a manifest
      is uploaded that describes how to concatenate them, enabling a
      single large object to be downloaded.
      .
      This option sets the maximum number of object segments allowed per
      large object, allowing control over the maximum large object size.
      The default minimum segment size is 1MB, while the maximum segment
      size corresponds to the largest object swift is configured
      to support (5GB by default).
      .
      Ex. Setting this to 1000 would allow up to 1000 5GB object segments
      to be uploaded for a maximum large object size of 5TB.
